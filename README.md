Homework statement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let us assume thatmvehicles are located in squares (1, 1) through (m, 1) (the bottomrow) of anm×msquared parking. The vehicles must be moved to the top row, but arranged inreverse order; so vehicleistarting from (i, 1) must end up in (m−i+1,m). On each time step, eachof themvehicles is restricted to move only one square up, down, left, or right, or keep currentposition (i.e.  does not move); but if a vehicle does not move, one other adjacent vehicle (butnot more than one) can hop over it. Two vehicles cannot occupy the same square.

a.  Write a detailed formulation for this search problem.
b.  Identify a suitable search algorithm for this task and explain your choice.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The task is to analyze the problems and fulfill the following requirements:

R1.  Implement the appropriate code to solve the assigned problem as a search problem.
R2.  Present and comment your experimental results and choices in a meaningful way.

NOTE:

In this repository there are 2 folders, one where the problem is solved, containing the implementation in Python language, and the other folder contains the documentation for this project, where the deliverables are described according to the project methodology.
For the experimental data a data generator was used, the final results are in the Code folder -> date_experimentale subfolder.
